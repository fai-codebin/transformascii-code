# Transformascii

This is a (just for fun) web + cli application to convert a video input as an ascii video in respect to the window size and position (to make it even more fun).

This is basically a companion code to a youtube video that you can see here -> https://youtu.be/_fva7bxc0dk.

## How to run

Install all python and javascript dependencies first  
```
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the webserver to open the web application  
```
npm start
```

Then open the `src/index.html` there

Open another window and run the python cli application
```
python src/cli.py
```

## Disclaimer

I have only tested this in windows, if it doesnt work in another operating system, then its probably time for you to fix it and create a PR ðŸ˜‰.

## Youtube

The youtube video was created and written using [motion canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/) and is available in the [youtube](./youtube/) dir, take a look in that directory if you want to see and find out how i created the video.

Just in case you want to ask how to run it, please dont, find out about it yourself, i have been good enough to share the video source code with you.
